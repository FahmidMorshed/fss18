\begin{abstract}
The effectiveness of a test suite is often measured with coverage and used as a proxy for its ability to detect faults. But unfortunately, previous studies failed to reach a consensus about the nature and strength of such relationship. \\ %, mostly due to small or synthetic programs, confounding influence of test suite size and using impractical adequate suites.\\
To study the relationship between test suite size, coverage and effectiveness, Inozemtseva et al.~\cite{inozemtseva2014coverage} used large Java programs with 31000 test suits for five systems consisting of up to 724,000 lines of source code. They measured different types of coverage and used mutation testing to evaluate their fault detection effectiveness.\\
They found that, there is a low to moderate correlation between coverage and effectiveness when the number of test cases in the suite is controlled for. Also, stronger forms of coverage do not provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the suite. Their results suggest that, coverage, while useful for identifying under-tested parts of a program, should not be used as a quality target because it is not a good indicator of test suite effectiveness.
