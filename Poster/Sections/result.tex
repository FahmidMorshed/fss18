\textbf{RQ1: Can a context-aware rank transformation provide predictive power comparable to the power of log transformation?}\\
rank transformations to the models built using log transformations. Table 1. presents the mean values of the six performance measures of both log and rank transformations, and the corresponding p-values of Wilcoxon rank sum test. The
results show the difference between the two transformations is small (i.e., less than 0.10). They concluded that rank transformation achieves comparable performance to log transformation. It is reasonable to use the proposed rank transformation method to build universal defect prediction models.\\
\textbf{RQ2: What is the performance of the universal defect
prediction model?}\\
and the AUC value. Hence, the context factors are good predictors for building a universal defect prediction model.\\
\textbf{RQ3: What is the performance of the universal defect prediction model on external projects?}\\
ble predictive power.
