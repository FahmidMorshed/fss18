\section{Results}

\textbf{RQ1: Is size correlated with effectiveness?}\\
There is a moderate to very high correlation between the effectiveness of a test suite and the number of test methods it contains (Pearson's $r^2$ value range of 0.26 to 0.97).\\

\textbf{RQ2: Is Coverage Correlated With Effectiveness When Size Is Ignored?}\\
There is a moderate to high correlation between the effectiveness and the coverage of a test suite when the influence of suite size is ignored. For normalized measurement, the Kendall's $\tau$ ranges from 0.50 to 0.80.\\

\textbf{RQ3: Is Coverage Correlated With Effectiveness When Size Is Fixed?}\\
The correlation between coverage and effectiveness drops when suite size is controlled for, typically ranges from low to moderate (from 0.1 to 0.4 in most cases), meaning it is not safe to assume that effectiveness is correlated with coverage. Additionally, from \ref{tab:coverageTable} shows that, the type of coverage used had little influence on the strength of the relationship.
