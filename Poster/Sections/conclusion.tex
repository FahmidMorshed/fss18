\section{Conclusion}
They studied the relationship between the number of methods in a programâ€™s test suite, statement, decision, and modified condition coverage, and mutant effectiveness measurement. These results imply that high levels of coverage do not indicate that a test suite is effective. Consequently, using a fixed coverage value as a quality target is unlikely to produce an effective test suite. In addition, complex coverage measurements may not provide enough additional information about the suite.
